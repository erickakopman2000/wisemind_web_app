# Wisemind Web-app

This is the web implementation (using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)) of the _**Wisemind**_ mobile app.

## Here's how to contribute:

#### Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/erickaorf/wisemind_web_app.git`

#### Change into the project directory and install the dependencies

`npm install`

### And you're good to go!

## Additional instructions for team members:

After you've cloned the repository and installed the dependencies, make sure to do the following.

#### Download the firebase.js file from dropbox (link provided in slack workspace) and add it to your _src_ directory.

#### Create a new branch before making any changes!

`git checkout -b <branch_name>`

#### After you've made changes and committed them, do not push the code directly to the _master_ branch! Push your branch to the remote repository.

`git push origin <your_branch_name>`

#### Create a _pull request_ to let other team members review your code before merging with the _master_ branch.

#### Please make sure to `git pull` every time you start coding and before you push your code to the remote repository, to avoid merge conflicts.
